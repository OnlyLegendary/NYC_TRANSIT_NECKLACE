# NYC_TRANSIT_NECKLACE
this is everything for my nyc transit necklace thing that i made hopefully the printer makes it good 
so the idea for this necklace is, it has the cool ingraving of the subway and the skyscrapers on it and on the side there is a small ring gap and the pcb has little lights that will make some green light shine through it so it looks cool! 
also this is for the TransitTime project
